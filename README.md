# ZILU Setup Guide

## Installation
#### pre-requirement
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) version 2.8 or later
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
* "make" and otherLLVM essential building tools, you can add if needed
* [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) the installation folder should be "/usr" or "/usr/local", otherwise you should modify $Z3_ROOT in cmake.base in the project directory so cmake can find it. 
* [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) This library is used to solve equations in our project.
* [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) only test llvm2.9 yet, so try to build KLEE by [build-llvm29](http://klee.github.io/build-llvm29/)


#### patch KLEE source code
This modification aims at generating smt2 file for each path condition.
The principle is to add a new method call **``klee_fail && klee_pass''**, and in its method handler we output the path condition to files.

##### these patch files are out-dated. Will update it soon, sorry for this inconvenience.
* [download patch file](http://lijiaying.github.io/content/iif/klee_patch.tar.bz2) This is only valid for KLEE by Dec. 2015.
* For the latest KLEE, please replace the following files with the files in [klee patch file](http://lijiaying.github.io/content/iif/klee_file_patch.tar.bz2).
1. KLEE_home_folder/include/klee/klee.h 
2. KLEE_home_folder/lib/Core/Executor.cpp
3. KLEE_home_folder/lib/Core/SpecialFunctionHandler.cpp
4. KLEE_home_folder/lib/Core/SpecialFunctionHandler.h
5. KLEE_home_folder/runtime/Runtest/instrinsics.c
6. KLEE_home_folder/tools/klee/main.cpp

##### Note:
+ The patch files are tested successfully if you use them just between KLEE configure step and KLEE make step. (between step 5 and 6 in [build-llvm29](http://klee.github.io/build-llvm29/))
+ Unpack the bz2 file, and then you can find "klee.patch" which is the patch file for whole KLEE project, ignore any warning during your patching process.
```
$ls
klee klee.patch filepatch
$cd klee
$patch -p1 <../klee.patch
```
+ If the last step does not work, you can patch each file by yourself. The patches for affected files are located in "klee_patch/filepatch" folder.
+ After the patch, you can continue to proceed KLEE make step (step 6 in [build-llvm29](http://klee.github.io/build-llvm29/))


#### Get ZILU
```
git clone git@github.com:lijiaying/ZILU.git
```

#### Test ZILU
```
cd ZILU
mkdir build
./run_once.sh zilu_linear1 
```

#### Notes
+ The 'zilu_linear1' is a file located in 'cfg' folder without extension.

#### Add a new test
- Follow the format such as 'cfg/template.cfg', put your test case in 'cfg' folder.
- And then try to run the system and see what happens.
